A latch is a type of memory device that stores a single bit of information. An SR latch has two inputs: S (Set) and R (Reset). It also has an output called Q. The S input is used to set the latch, while the R input resets it.

As shown in the table, this is how the SR latch operates.
However, by design, when both S and R are activated simultaneously, it results in an invalid input, making the value of Q undefined.

The circuit has two inputs: COIN and VEND. Pressing the COIN button simulates inserting a coin, while pressing the VEND button triggers the machine to dispense an item, indicated by an LED turning on.

## RaspBerry Pi
The Raspberry Pi features General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins, which can function as either inputs or outputs. These pins allow the Raspberry Pi to control or interact with external devices by sending or receiving signals. Some pins are dedicated to providing constant power (5V or 3.3V) or ground connections. It's important to note that the physical pin numbers do not always correspond to the GPIO numbers used in programming, so using the correct GPIO number is essential when writing code.
